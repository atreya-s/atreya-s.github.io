I am a graduate researcher at the AIMP lab at Northwestern University, being advised by [Dr. Bo Zhou](https://bbbbbbzhou.github.io). I'm currently working towards a Master's thesis through the department of Biomedial Engineering. I was formerly an undergraduate reseacher at INVent Labs at Case Western Reserve university, being advised by [Dr. Satish E. Viswanath](https://case.edu/cancer/members/member-directory/satish-e-viswanath), where I got my degrees in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics.
