My name is Atreya, and I enjoy working on deep learning and computer vision models, with a focus on understanding how these models work and behave.

* My research interests are:
    * Foundation Models for Medical Image
    * Multimodal Learning
    * Deep Learning Theory

Outside of research, I am known to enjoy the Benne Dosa and Biryani ☺️

Always looking to collaborate on projects!
