My name is Atreya, and I like to work on Vision models and investigate their viability.
<br>
* My research interests are:
    * Applied Computer Vision for Medicine
    * Mechanistic Interpretability
    * Deep Learning Theory


I aim to explore the intersection of vision and deep learning theory, with an emphasis on making these models more interpretable and usable in applied domains.

Outside of research, I am also known to enjoy Benne Dosa and Biryani ☺️

Always looking to collaborate on projects!
